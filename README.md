- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @FraG1le and I'm from Germany.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning code. I've only just started coding and learning informatics because I 
     want to do an apprenticeship as an <i>"IT specalist for application development"</i>.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning <b><html 5> / {css 3} && {JavaScript}</b>
- I don't know what else to write right now and will add more information later! :)
